First, they are often in primary sexual relationships with male drug users. Second, like their male peers, some continue to use drugs despite being in treatment. When under the influence of drugs, especially cocaine or crack, they are more likely to engage in unprotected sex.

On the other hand, there is research that shows that this minority group carries attitudes and beliefs about substance abuse that may be barriers to participation in substance abuse treatment. A few studies do indicate, however, that efforts to motivate substance-abusing Hispanics can be effective in bringing them into treatment. One such intervention, Motivational Enhancement Therapy (MET), is a promising intervention that may increase Hispanic clients\u2019 commitment to change and reduce their resistance to entering treatment.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate buspirone's efficacy, relative to placebo, in blocking reinstatement of cocaine use as assessed by the maximum days of continuous cocaine abstinence, as assessed by twice-weekly UDS and self-report, during study weeks 4-15. The study also evaluated the impact of buspirone, relative to placebo, on other drug-abuse outcomes and on factors that may mediate buspirone\u2019s efficacy as a relapse-prevention treatment.",
